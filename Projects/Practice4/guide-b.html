                    Bhaktapur, known as the City of Devotees, is one of the best-preserved medieval towns in Nepal.
                    Walking through its brick-paved streets and narrow alleys feels like stepping back in time, as
                    traditional Newar life continues almost unchanged for centuries. The city is filled with ancient
                    temples, palaces, and courtyards where rituals and daily worship are still an important part of
                    life. Festivals like the Bisket Jatra turn the entire city into a celebration, with massive chariots
                    pulled through the streets and crowds gathering to honor their deities. Bhaktapur is also famous for
                    its craftsmanship, with artisans still practicing pottery, woodcarving, and weaving in the same way
                    their ancestors did. The combination of living heritage, vibrant traditions, and strong community
                    spirit makes Bhaktapur a city where culture is not just preserved but lived every day.

                    Food in Bhaktapur is a delicious reflection of its Newar heritage and is an essential part of the
                    city’s identity. The most famous local specialty is Juju Dhau, the “king of curd,” a creamy yogurt
                    served in clay pots that has become a symbol of Bhaktapur. Newari dishes such as Chatamari, often
                    called Nepali pizza, and Bara, savory lentil patties, are widely enjoyed in local homes and street
                    stalls. Samay Baji, a traditional feast plate with beaten rice, fried meat, soybeans, and pickles,
                    showcases the richness of Newar cuisine and is often prepared during festivals and special
                    occasions. Street food culture is also vibrant here, with freshly cooked snacks sold in the bustling
                    markets and small shops. Rooftop restaurants and traditional eateries give visitors the chance to
                    taste these authentic dishes while overlooking the city’s ancient temples and squares, creating a
                    perfect blend of food and atmosphere.

                    Bhaktapur is often described as a living museum because of its well-preserved monuments and
                    traditional lifestyle. The heart of the city is Bhaktapur Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage
                    Site filled with palaces, temples, and courtyards that display extraordinary Newar architecture. The
                    towering Nyatapola Temple in Taumadhi Square is another landmark, its five-tiered structure standing
                    as one of the tallest and most impressive pagodas in Nepal. Pottery Square is where visitors can
                    watch artisans skillfully shape clay by hand, continuing a centuries-old tradition that still
                    thrives today. In Dattatreya Square, ancient temples and the famous Peacock Window reveal the
                    artistry of woodcarving that Bhaktapur is celebrated for. Every corner of the city tells a story,
                    and beyond the monuments, the slow rhythm of daily life makes Bhaktapur a place where history and
                    tradition are still woven into the present.
