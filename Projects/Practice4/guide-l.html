One of the most beloved local treats is Yomari, a steamed dumpling filled with jaggery and sesame that is celebrated with its own festival every year. Other popular dishes include Bara, a savory lentil patty, and Chatamari, often called the “Nepali pizza,” which are commonly found in homes and eateries. Samay Baji, with beaten rice, fried meat, soybeans, and pickles, remains a highlight of Newari cuisine and is served during both everyday meals and special occasions. The city is also filled with cozy cafes and rooftop restaurants where traditional dishes are paired with modern twists, giving both locals and visitors a wide variety of culinary experiences.
