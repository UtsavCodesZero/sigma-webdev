                    Kathmandu is often called the cultural heart of Nepal. The city is home to centuries-old temples,
                    palaces,
                    and courtyards that showcase the living heritage of the Newars, the indigenous people of the valley.
                    Festivals are celebrated throughout the year, from the colorful Indra Jatra to the chariot-pulling
                    of
                    Rato
                    Machindranath. You will often see locals making daily offerings of flowers and incense at shrines
                    tucked
                    into busy streets.

                    Art and architecture here blend Hindu and Buddhist traditions, with intricately carved wooden
                    windows,
                    pagoda-style temples, and golden stupas. Visiting Kathmandu is not only about sightseeing but also
                    about
                    experiencing a way of life where spirituality and community come first.
